## Using Your Website

The website features a single-page layout with smooth scrolling navigation. When you first visit, you see the hero section announcing the event dates.

Click "Register Your Team" to begin registration, or click "View Schedule" to jump directly to the timeline. The navigation bar at the top includes quick links to "About", "Schedule", "Prizes", and "Team" sections.

To register for the hackathon, click any "Register Now" button throughout the site. Fill in your "Full Name" and "Email Address" in the required fields. Enter your "Team Name" if you already have one, or leave it blank if registering solo. Select your "Team Size" from 1 to 4 members, then choose your "Experience Level" from beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Optionally add your "Areas of Interest" and any "Dietary Restrictions" to help organizers accommodate your needs. Click "Complete Registration" to submit your form. You will see a confirmation message with a green checkmark icon.

The schedule section displays the complete three-day timeline. Friday evening starts with registration at 6:00 PM, followed by the opening ceremony and team formation. Hacking officially begins at 8:00 PM. Saturday includes workshops, mentor sessions, and meals throughout the day. Sunday features the final sprint, project submissions at noon, presentations in the afternoon, and the awards ceremony at 5:00 PM.
